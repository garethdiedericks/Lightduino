# Lightduino
##Introduction
Lightduino is a laser tag game comaptible to the the light strike system from wowwee (http://www.lightstrike.com/).

I created this project because the original lightstrike toy has not a really long range and is not as acurated as it could be.

Surely there is a more professional system for laser tagging (Miles Laser Tag, see http://www.lasertagparts.com/mtdesign.htm), however this is really expensive and too military centric (for me). My goal is to provide the steps to create a cheap (~50 Euro/US-Dollar) gun to have fun with friends.

##Features
So if you are going to construct your own lightduino marker you got the following features
 - Currently compatible with the Light Strike System from wowwee (http://www.lightstrike.com/)
 - Possibility to create a rifle (reloading, a lot of ammo, slow shot rate) or create a gun (no reloading, less ammo, faster shot rate)
 - Choose between for teams (blue/red/yellow/green)
 - an oled screen with some information on it
 - an integrated laser pointer, so you are able to see where you are shooting at

##ToDo:
- Get a cheap way for audio output
- use interrupts for hit/shot, so that the screen or audio output doesn't slow down the hit processing
- Get Wifi Onboard for future games modes (ESP8266?)
- Future game modes! (Zombie Apocalypse/Vampires/Capture the Flag/Ninatag/King of the hill)
- Translate game modes to english
